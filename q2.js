/* An object in JavaScript is a collection of properties, where each property has a name or key and a value.
The value can be a primitive data type, such as a number or a string, or another object, such as an array or a function.
Objects are used to store and manipulate complex data in JavaScript.
Objects can be created using different ways, such as object literals, constructors, or the Object.create() method.
An Each object has an internal link to another object, called its prototype.
The prototype object can also have its own properties and methods, which are inherited by the objects that link to it. */
