/* // The difference between HTTP1 and HTTP2 is mainly in how they transfer data between the client and the server. 
HTTP1 uses plain text messages that are sent one at a time over a single connection.
while HTTP2 uses binary frames that are multiplexed over a single connection. 
HTTP2 also has features like header compression, faster, more efficient, and more secure than HTTP1 */
